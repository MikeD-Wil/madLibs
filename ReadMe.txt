<! --in a few weeks we are going to use JavaScript to make a mad libs project. Today we are going to start on the static elements of our mad Libs project using HTML and CSS. Please take the following steps.

1. Google a mad libs story you would like to use.
2. Create a new project folder and place an index.html and style.css file in it.
3. Give your index.html an h1 heading with the title of your page or story.
4. Below your h1 heading add text inputs for each fill-in-the-blank portion of your mad libs. Please use placeholders and labels to inform the user what kind of word they should use.
5. Below your text inputs, add a paragraph with the mad libs story you plan to use (we will update this when we work on this project a few weeks from now)
6. Use your style.css file to make the project as professional an appearance as possible.
7.Please turn in a github link to your repository
